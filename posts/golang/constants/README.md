# Constants

* Constants are declared same as variables but using `const` instead of `var`

* Constants types can be: 
	* `string`
	* `text characters`
	* `bool`
	* `number types`

* Note: **CONSTANTS CAN'T BE DECLARED USING :=**

### Numeric constants

	* Numeric constants are values with *high precision*
	* Constant declared without type, initialise type via context
