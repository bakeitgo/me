# imports

* Why we use imports?
	* By imports we can consume packages.

* You can import packages in 2 ways:
	* By writing 1by1 `import "packagename"` in new lines
	* By grouping them in parentheses: `
	import (
		"packagename1"
		"packagename2"
	)`

* Note: *A good practice is to use grouped imports*
