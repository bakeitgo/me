### How data can be stored

* columnstore - slower reads(need to decompress), slower disk size (due to compression)
* rowstore - faster reads, inceased disk size



####  Types of queries

* direct (punktowy) - where we select rows due to bool clause like where
* grouping - where we group by


#### Indexes (index key with selected columns)

## Clustered index

* sorted ones

## Non Clustered index


## Indexes
* non sorted ones, slower than clustered index

    * clustered row index

        * When we want to speed up direct queries based on specific criteria

    * clustered column index
    
        * Not sorted, data is stored on different pages physically, slower than row one, but data takes less size

        * best in grouping queries, best for analytics

## Compression

* page

    * best in reducing disk size

    * increased query time

* row

    * good in reducing disk size

    * slightly increase (can decrease due to reduced disk size) query time
