# Shell, Terminal, CLI

* What is CLI? It's REPL(Read,Evaluate,Print,Loop)

* Shell is a program which is a kernel shell (sends commands to kernel) (for ex. bash)
* Terminal was found on early PC's, now we are using terminal emulator which is used to send commands to a shell program for ex. bash (Bourne Against Shell)
* CLI is nothing else than Single command line send by the user, using ENTER (return)
