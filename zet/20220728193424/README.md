# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip").

* First bullet
* Second bullet
* Third bullet

What is i want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

But when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
1. Second
1. Third

But when you want to write some code: 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}

```

How about something that look like `code`?

And when i have URL i want it to print also so I always write it out like this:

https://rwx.gg

* I put references at the bottom

    #zettel #notes #rwx
