# Sysaccount / files linux / other stuff

* vim /etc/passwd

* Everything which has uid 0 is root
* files and directories have uid and gids which are independent from the system. why? cause now you cano move files/directories to another system. Why it is risky? Because when you take files/dirs to another system, moved files with e.g.userid 1000 will be readable by first created user on another sys
## IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM! TAKE CARE OF THAT!!
* How do I link to a file or directory?
* What's a glob?
