# UNIX LINUX Topic

* everything is a file in the unix "inode" entry in the table - information node
* permissions
* How we know 'apt' packages are safe? This is a reason why enterprises uses ubuntu and red hat distros, not arch, because arch user repository is not safe. In debian teams, they approve every package. 
* Mainly used in enterprises distros: RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), Ubuntu
* They are different in package manager (Ubuntu uses apt and .deb files, RHEL uses dnf or rpm and .rpm files)
* Ubuntu is Free, RHEL is not.
* RHEL and Fedora uses SELINUX as a security system, Ubuntu uses AppArmor
* If u want use RHEL for free, the nearest distro is Fedora, based on Debian like Ubuntu.
* Fedora uses dnf as package manager and support .rpm files
