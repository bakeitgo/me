# Cloud computing / On-premise


* What is an on-premise environment?

	* On-premise is an local environment, it is an infrastructure where we need to manage, scale, and maintaining by ourselves. In this type of environment there is huge problem with scalability, because e.g. we cannot easily (time-save) add more servers when we need them, and delete them when we don't need them anymore. **Scalability** of On-premise env leads to huge cost, and time consuming practice. **Security** we need to maintain by ourselves also. We need to obtain that our servers are secure in the IT sector, from black hat attackers, and  access from not authorised users is not easily provided. **Backup** - we need to provide it by ourselves.

* What is cloud computing environment?

	* Cloud computing environment have huge scalability, we can easily add, delete servers when we need / don't need them, and we don't have to care about maintaining, manage and **STORE** our environment locally. **Security** and **backup** in this env. is handled by our provider


* What about cloud computing environment types?

	* Private cloud - is like local environment (On-premise) but to name it like **Private cloud** it should be automated, have easy implementation of new instances, and provide easy maintaining of apps.

	* Public cloud - is a environment which is fully provided by cloud provider.

	* Hybrid cloud - Some shit we gotcha on on-premise environment, like database center, other we got on public cloud. 

	* Multi cloud - It's like hybrid cloud but only using public clouds.


* What about infrastructure models?

	* &#9748; ***WORD*** - You maintain
	* WORD - Provider maintain
