# Programming in C

## Program Structure

* An overview of C programs and program execution.

### Source files and source programs

* Source program can be divided into one or more **source files** or **translation unit** (input to the compiler)

* Source program contains all instructions, declarations, functions etc. in specified order with specific syntax

### Directives

* Directive instructs program to perform specific action on the text before compilation - **preprocessor directives**
> #define MAX 100

### Pragmas

* Pragmas are used in compilation to instruct compiler to perform particular action, for e.g. to optimise your program with ```optimize``` pragma
